Motor Subsystem - VHDL
* Assumes 100MHz clock
* Assumes TBD (20 ms) period for PWM pulse
- 4 duty cycle inputs as input registers
- 1 enable pulse input
- 4 direction bits in a register
- drive 4 PWM outputs and 4 direction outputs
- output 4 encoder outputs registers; with writable bit for clearing registers
- 8 encoder inputs (2 for each motor) - uses process for adding ticjs in the count registers
- Accelerate up and down to new duty cycles (acceleration curve) eg. currently 10% duty - need to update to 20%
