Notes:
==============
measure ticks of encoder a inputs - when they go high - count ticks

Encoder input B not needed:
but direction can be determined by phase shift of encoder input A with respect encoder input B (ie. +/- 90degree phase shift)

Use rising edge syncronizer and counter for encoder input A and count number of ticks between two pulses. This tick count is the representation
of encoder rotation speed. 
take ticks and multiply by clk speed (100MHz), gear ratio (87:1) and wheel diameter

- in "setup" push values for the multiply factors to memory - parameterization 

functional tests for each hardware component to test subsystems
IMU does not measure rotation it measures rotation velocity (need integation)


PDR contains:
======================
team introduction
highlevel blockdiagram (label parts - m1, m2) - nomenclature
hw/sw - terms/architecture - register map and how they communicate
subsystem slides
 - eg. encoder processor subsystem - function call - register
Cost and scheduling
CDR estimates
Our advantage - "why pick us?" - sompetitive advantage - eg. optimization
