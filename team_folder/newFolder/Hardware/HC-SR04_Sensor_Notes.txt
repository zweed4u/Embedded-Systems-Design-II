HC-SR04 Info

:=================

Max range = 4 meters

Max time = 23.5294118 milliseconds (using formula below solving for width)
Min time = 117.6470588 microseconds
*** suggested to use over 60ms measurement cycle

 speed of sound = 340 meters/second 
divide by 2 because signal goes and comes back 
- need half 

Formula:
Using the speed of sound ~340 meters/second
(distance in meters) = (width of pulse in seconds) * (speed of sound) / 2 

or simply:

170 * (time in seconds) = (distance in meters)

(distance in cm) = (width of pulse in MICROseconds) / 58
(distance in inches) = (width of pulse in MICROseconds) / 148



Sensor Process:

1. set trigger pin high for 10 microseconds (sleep) and then set low

2. wait to receive echo pulse on echo pin

3. start counter to count until pulse on echo pin goes low

4. get counter and convert into usable measurement
