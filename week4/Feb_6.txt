Lab2
VHDL modelsim
variables: period (std_logic_vector), duty_cycle, enable

Lab3
program lab 2 on snickerdoodle & verify with scope

Lab4
GUI of the program on snickerdoodle with option to adjust variables (period, duty cycle and enable)

Check polarity out of snickerdoodle
0 out could be 0V OR 12V


PWM update rate within bandwidth of motor results in quick "jitter", outside of motor's bandwidth results in the average voltage
Moto will see 6V in 12V input with PWM 50% duty cycle

thursday task
get tasks figured out/hours


fpga vs processor tasks
C or python?
