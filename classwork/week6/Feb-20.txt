MPU9250 - encoders - i2c (vhdl)
HC-SR04 - ultrasonic
OV5642 - camera driver
DRV8871 - pwm driver for camera
encoders - 3.3 volts coming in as pulse

JTAG is a debugging tool (similar to altera signaltap)

Ultrasonics (hint: trigger is is stimulating with radiation - not passive - LIDAR active) - interferrence???
4 PWMs driven with duty cycle

Lab3 - blink led in python on snickerdoodle - see on scope

FPGA receives all pins but can be fed right to processor

March 8th is PDR - preliminary design review - 1/2 hour slide presentation
Focus on Design!!!

Don't couple!!! Isolate enables!!
