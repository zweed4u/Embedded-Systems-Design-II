PDR Review

PDR - preliminary design review (dollars)
TIM - technical interchange meeting (tech)
CDR (dollars)

PDR tips:
know your room - washed out powerpoints - room's lighting
text size - oldest person in room / 2
word process equations - not handwritten
public speaking - toastmasters - international public speaking group
stay away from - "I think", "I might", "it should", "maybe"- INSTEAD use "we'll get back to you on that"
introductions - have slide with name while introducing
not too much low level detail - opening yourself up to higher level of scrutiny from tech savvy persons in audience and half of the audience phases out anyways
know your audience
always do a double check (eg. hours needed to completion)

New Folder 12k and spend another 7k => each member only needs 2hrs a week
Gremm 15k and spend another 55k => each member needs 18hrs a week
HASHTAG  3k and spend another 10k => each member only needs 3hrs a week


HASHTAG wins from best price

people will pay a premium if an object will work - can't sacrifice tech

CDR slide template - slides with headers/top text
