Processor Architecture (of the Zynq)
advantage of DMA - direct 1 program counter in processor - DMA can transport memory around chip without bogging down processor

L1 cache linked into processor - on chip memory - very small
L2 cache same as L1 but shared betwen processors - useful with threads - AMP and SMP ways to run Linux - both processors visible to linux - OS can access all CPUs
On chip Memory (OCM) - accessible/links directly to L2 or FPGA - think of scratchpad  - not cached

Deteministic tasks on bare metal core - not on Linux OS CPU  (Hard real time C code)

DDR memory ~1GB read into L1 cache and can start executing - if next instruction not in cache - cache miss - need to fetch page from DDR
