Process

1) Pick parts (most important processing) - split into active (power needed, processor, amplifier) and passive (resistors, discretes, diodes, caps) components

2) how they connect together (create schematic)

3) layout/simulate/test schematic in PSPICE, Multisim - THERMAL ANALYSIS - No 90 degree angles! - Voltage will "bounce" back from where it originated from - all about getting the electrons from spot to another - wiggles needed in high frequency designs so that trace lengths are of same length, same propogation delay to get to the same component at the same time (eg. in DDR4 - matter of picoseconds)

4) send off to FAB (gerber file - (~6) layer/s of boards)

*Rat's nest direct premilinary connections from component to component

In EAGLE - 
RAM has MANY pins look for this for microprocessor

====
Rules to design by:
- Select the right task to do is more important than doing the wrong task right (system engineer - what task needs to be done)
- design twice, code once
- develop and verify in a modular fashion (pong speed methods - reduce top level - modular way: give ball its own timer to update)
- burn down risk before it burns you (schedule 'riskier' tasks first)
- isolation of variables is a must (modularize)
- baseline your work (run basic setup)
- save milestones as they will save you (version control)
- find your style. listen to the experts dont duplicate them
- say 'hello world' or 'blink the LED'
- select tasks for the minimum winning game (minimum effort - be lazy)
- make it work (demo), make it right (peers), make it fast (optimization)
